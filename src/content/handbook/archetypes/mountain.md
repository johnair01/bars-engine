## The Archetype's Story

You're the person who can be completely still in the middle of chaos. Not frozen from fear, but choosing deliberate stopping because you know that motion without purpose is just noise. You're the mountain that doesn't chase, doesn't react—just IS.

Mountain energy is about conscious stillness. When everyone else is running around, you stop and assess. You rest when others exhaust themselves. Your immobility isn't passive—it's the most active choice possible.

**Example Archetypes**:
- The Immovable Presence
- The Deliberate Stopper
- The Resting Power

### In the Robot Oscars Heist

You're the one who says "Wait." Who stops the crew before they make a fatal mistake in their rush. Your construct holds position absolutely, creating the still point that lets everyone else orient.

**Your construct affinity**: Defensive positions, anchoring systems, stillness protocols

**Your strength**: You STOP. You REST. You hold ground.

**Your challenge**: Everyone wants you to DO something. The pressure to move is constant.

**Your triumph**: When your perfect stillness reveals exactly the right moment to act.
