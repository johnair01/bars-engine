## The Archetype's Story

You're the person who sees what's needed and does something about it—not because you're in charge, but because waiting feels impossible. When everyone's stuck deliberating, you're the spark that breaks the paralysis.

Heaven energy isn't about leadership—it's about creative force. You're the one who starts things, who moves when movement matters, who persists through resistance not because you're stubborn but because you genuinely see the path forward.

**Example Archetypes**:
- The Catalyst Who Can't Not Act
- The Creative Initiator
- The Unstoppable Spark

### In the Robot Oscars Heist

You're the energy that gets things moving. Not directing others, but being so committed to action that momentum naturally gathers around you. When the heist stalls, you're already taking the next step—and somehow everyone else follows.

**Your construct affinity**: First-strike systems, momentum builders, initiative cores

**Your strength**: You ACT. You PERSIST. You break paralysis.

**Your challenge**: Sometimes others need space to find their own timing. Not everything needs your spark right now.

**Your triumph**: When your bold action transforms "stuck" into "already happening."
