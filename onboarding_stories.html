      Welcome to the Conclave. We've been expecting you.

      The security for the Robot Oscars is tighter than a clam with trust issues this year, but you made it in. The big
      event is just around the corner, and frankly, we're short a few brilliant minds for the... *festivities*.

      [[I'm ready. What's the job?->The Job]]
      [[Robot Oscars? Explain.->The Job Context]]
    </tw-passagedata>

    <tw-passagedata pid="2" name="The Job Context" tags="" x="100" y="250">
      Only the most prestigious gathering of construct technology in the galaxy. And the perfect place for a...
      reallocation of assets.

      We're here to pull off the heist of the century. But first, we need to get you processed.

      [[Let's get started.->The Job]]
    </tw-passagedata>

    <tw-passagedata pid="3" name="The Job" tags="inputs" x="300" y="100">
      I have your invitation here, but the ink is a bit smudged. Smells like... motor oil and expensive cologne.

      Just a formality. Though I do enjoy a good codename.

      (This is where your dossier begins. Prepare yourself.)

    <tw-passagedata pid="4" name="End" tags="" x="300" y="250">
      The blueprints are clear, the crew is assembled, but every major job needs a signature—a reason.

      Tell me, what brings a soul like yours into the Conclave? What's the signal you're sending out into the void?

      You've reached the perimeter of the Robot Oscars. A high-resolution security drone floats toward you, sensors
      glowing a skeptical crimson.

      It emits a series of chirps—the standard challenge protocol. How do you respond?

      [[[Logic] Present a perfectly forged permit.->The Inner Loop]]
      [[[Passion] Overload its sensors with a burst of static.->The Inner Loop]]
      [[[Joy] Distract it with a playful hologram.->The Inner Loop]]
      [[[Balance] Negotiate a trade for its silence.->The Inner Loop]]
      [[[Memory] Share a record of its creator.->The Inner Loop]]

    <tw-passagedata pid="2" name="The Inner Loop" tags="" x="300" y="100">
      You're inside the maintenance tunnels, but the layout is a shifting kaleidoscope of steel. The blueprint you have
      is outdated—reconstruction is ongoing for the gala.

      A crossroads lies ahead. One path smells of ozone, another echoes with distant laughter, and a third is eerily
      silent.

      [[[Logic] Map the likely layout from acoustics.->Identity Match]]
      [[[Passion] Force a new path through that vent.->Identity Match]]
      [[[Joy] Follow the laughter; it leads to the party.->Identity Match]]
      [[[Balance] Watch the staff; flow with their rhythm.->Identity Match]]
      [[[Memory] Recall the architect's signature style.->Identity Match]]

    <tw-passagedata pid="3" name="Identity Match" tags="" x="500" y="100">
      Based on how you navigated the approach, your resonance is becoming clear. We are all shaped by where we come
      from.

      Choose your nation. This determines your initial toolkit and social status within the Conclave.

      A conflict breaks out between two of the heist members during the final briefing. Tensions are high; tools are
      being gripped a bit too tightly, and voices are rising.

      The mission is at risk before it even begins. How do you intercede?

      [[[The Movers] Take control of the room immediately.->The Breakthrough]]
      [[[The Connectors] Find common ground and de-escalate.->The Breakthrough]]
      [[[The Shifters] Redirect the energy and move past it.->The Breakthrough]]

    <tw-passagedata pid="2" name="The Breakthrough" tags="" x="300" y="100">
      You've reached the target: a heavy vault door protected by a vibrational lock that responds to emotional
      frequency. Standard tech won't touch it.

      You must project a specific intent to resonate with the tumblers. What do you channel?

      [[[The Movers] Pure, driving will and command.->The Way]]
      [[[The Connectors] Resonance and harmony with the field.->The Way]]
      [[[The Shifters] A fluid, adaptive rhythm that shifts.->The Way]]
      [[[The Anchors] Unwavering clarity and stillness.->The Way]]
    </tw-passagedata>

    <tw-passagedata pid="3" name="The Way" tags="" x="500" y="100">
      Your way of moving through the world is clear. The I Ching archetypes are more than just roles—they are the way
      you express your power.

      Select your archetype. This defines your unique moves and your contribution to the heist.

      The heist is planned. Your identity is established. You are a member of the Conclave now.

      But a movement is more than just individual parts—it's the signal we send together.

      [[Ready to send my signal.->Final Signal]]
    </tw-passagedata>

    <tw-passagedata pid="2" name="Final Signal" tags="inputs" x="300" y="100">
      Tell the Conclave: What is the one truth you want to amplify? What is the signal you're putting into the field
      today?

      This is your final initiation step. Once submitted, the full engine is yours to command.
