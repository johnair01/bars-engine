# Database Synchronization Rule

When you modify the file `prisma/schema.prisma`, you MUST automatically run the following command to synchronize the database and regenerate types:

```bash
npm run db:sync
```

This ensures that:
1. The database schema is updated (via `prisma db push`).
2. The Prisma Client is regenerated with new types.
3. Other developers on different machines receive the updates seamlessly.

Do not wait for the user to ask; execute this command as a post-modification step.
