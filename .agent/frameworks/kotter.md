# Kotter Model for Development

John Kotter's change model applied to our feature cycle.

## The 8 Steps

| Step | Dev Application |
|------|-----------------|
| 1. **Create Urgency** | User request defines "why now" |
| 2. **Form Coalition** | Agent + User align via `implementation_plan.md` |
| 3. **Create Vision** | Plan articulates end state |
| 4. **Communicate Vision** | `task.md` tracks progress |
| 5. **Remove Obstacles** | Identify blockers early, escalate |
| 6. **Create Short-Term Wins** | Deploy vertical slices |
| 7. **Build on Change** | Each release builds on last |
| 8. **Anchor in Culture** | Document patterns in workflows |

## Application

- Before starting: Steps 1-3 (Planning)
- During work: Steps 4-6 (Execution)
- After completion: Steps 7-8 (Integration)
