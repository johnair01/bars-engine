# Integral Development

Ken Wilber's AQAL framework applied to software.

## Four Quadrants

| Quadrant | Focus | Check |
|----------|-------|-------|
| **UL (I)** | Intent, clarity | Functions readable? Names meaningful? |
| **UR (It)** | Behavior | Tests pass? Performance OK? |
| **LL (We)** | Shared understanding | Docs clear? Patterns consistent? |
| **LR (Its)** | Systems | Architecture sound? Deploys cleanly? |

## Development Stages

- **Purple/Red**: It works (basic functionality)
- **Blue**: It's reliable (structure, rules)
- **Orange**: It's optimized (performance, UX)
- **Green**: It's empathetic (accessibility, delight)
- **Yellow+**: It evolves (emergence, adaptation)

## Code Review Checklist

- [ ] UL: Is the intent clear?
- [ ] UR: Does it work correctly?
- [ ] LL: Will others understand it?
- [ ] LR: Does it fit the system?
