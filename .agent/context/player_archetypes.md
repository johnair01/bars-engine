# Player Archetypes & The Vibeulon Engine

> *"The first rule of vibeulons is that the vibes must flow."*

---

## The Deep Structure

```
HEXAGRAM = UPPER TRIGRAM + LOWER TRIGRAM
        = WHERE YOU'RE GOING + WHERE YOU ARE
        = TARGET STAGE + CURRENT STAGE
```

Each I Ching reading produces a hexagram—two archetypes in relationship. This teaches players to embody their most effective self at the right time, in alignment with the sage.

**This is the essence of Teal consciousness**: seeing the whole system, knowing when to act from which center, trusting the emergent wisdom.

## Hexagram Quest Mechanics

When a quest is cast, the hexagram reveals:

```
┌─────────────────┐
│  UPPER TRIGRAM  │  ← Target State (Where to go)
│    (Stage N+1)  │
├─────────────────┤
│  LOWER TRIGRAM  │  ← Current State (Where you are)
│    (Stage N)    │
└─────────────────┘
```

### Example: Hexagram 11 (Peace/Tai)

```
☷ Earth (above)  → Stage 2: Coalition
☰ Heaven (below) → Stage 3: Vision
```

**Reading**: You have the vision (Heaven/Reformer energy below). Now build the coalition (Earth/Helper energy above). The sage says: share your clarity with others who can help manifest it.

**Player Prompt**: "Which Helper in your circle can carry this vision forward?"

## The Teal Teaching

Each quest is a micro-lesson in integral development:

| Level | Learning |
|-------|----------|
| **Amber** | Follow the rules of the game |
| **Orange** | Optimize your moves for vibeulons |
| **Green** | Consider all player perspectives |
| **Teal** | Know which archetype to embody when |
| **Turquoise** | See the whole system dancing |

The game trains players to:
1. **Recognize** which stage a situation is in
2. **Embody** the archetype that serves that stage
3. **Trust** the sage's guidance on timing
4. **Flow** vibeulons by being the right energy at the right moment

## Implementation Notes

Each quest should track:
- **Current Stage** (1-8)
- **Hexagram Cast** (which two archetypes in play)
- **Active Moves** (what players can do now)
- **Vibeulons Generated** (when right move × right stage)
