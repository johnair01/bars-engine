# Bars Engine

> **Status:** MVP Logic Implemented (Feb 21 Party Target)

The **Bars Engine** is a narrative-driven quest system designed for the vibrational convergence. It powers a "choose your own adventure" style experience where players (Conclave members) complete quests, manage resources (Vibeulons), and evolve their characters through archetypal moves.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the engine running locally.

### 1. Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18+)
- SQLite (for local development)

### 2. Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Initialize Database (Run Migrations)
npx prisma migrate dev --name init

# Seed Initial Data (Roles, Bars, Admin Invite)
# This populates the database with essential game data.
npm run db:seed
```

### 3. Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the root directory if it doesn't exist:

```env
DATABASE_URL="file:./dev.db"
```

### 4. Run Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the application.

## 🛠 Operational Commands

We have several utility scripts to help manage the game state.

| Command | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `npm run db:reset` | **Hard Reset**: Wipes the database and re-seeds it. Use with caution. |
| `npm run db:studio` | Opens Prisma Studio to visualize and edit database records. |
| `npm run db:push` | Pushes schema changes to the database without creating a migration file. |
| `npm run loop:ready` | Runs a readiness check for the game loop. |
| `npm run test:actions` | Runs server action tests. |

## 🏗 Architecture Overview

- **Framework**: Next.js 14+ (App Router)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (Production) / SQLite (Dev), managed via Prisma ORM.
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS.
- **Key Concepts**:
  - **Player**: The central entity.
  - **Bar**: A unit of narrative/quest content. Can be system-generated or user-created (`CustomBar`).
  - **Vibeulon**: The currency of the realm.
  - **Archetypes**: `Nation` and `Playbook` determine character moves and story progression.
  - **Story Clock**: A global state tracker for the narrative phase.
