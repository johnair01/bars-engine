**Element**: Earth 🏔️

## The Nation's Setting

Meridia stands at high noon, where light eliminates all shadows. This is the nation of clear sight, fair exchange, and the understanding that true power comes not from domination but from win-win thinking.

Walk through Meridia's markets and you'll see exchanges happening at every level—not just goods, but ideas, energy, value itself. Their constructs are fortress-like yet graceful. Their citizens see through pretense not with cynicism but with the kind clarity of midday sun.

**The Culture**:
- **Values**: Clarity, balance, fairness, mutual benefit
- **Aesthetic**: Golden light, balanced constructs, open markets
- **Philosophy**: "Stand in full light. See clearly. Deal fairly. Everyone wins."

**What Makes Meridia Distinct**:
- They're masters of negotiation—every conflict is an opportunity for mutual benefit
- Their constructs balance offense and defense, individual and collective
- Shadow work is transactional: release old patterns by trading them for new ones
- Attachments are released through conscious, fair exchange

## Playing from Meridia

**What it means to be Meridian in the heist**:

You see clearly—the guards are just doing their jobs. The corrupt capitalist is wrong, but also motivated by understandable fears. Your crew has competing needs. And somehow, you need to find the deal where everyone gets what they need.

Your construct doesn't dominate—it provides center of gravity. When you sync with Meridian tech, you become the immovable point that lets everyone else risk movement.

**Your nation's role in the heist**: The diplomatic center. Getting past obstacles through negotiation, finding allies, creating win-wins that turn problems into opportunities. And maybe—just maybe—offering the capitalist a better deal than corruption.

**Your development arc**: Learning that sometimes perfect balance means not choosing sides when you SHOULD. That clarity + fairness is powerful, but some situations demand you stand with one side fully.

- Defensive systems that protect while enabling movement
- Support capabilities that empower allies

## Meridia in the Larger World

**Historical Role**: The mediators who've prevented countless wars through finding mutual benefit. Their market principles shaped inter-nation trade.

**Current Tension**: Pyrakanth thinks they're too cautious. Virelune finds them naive. But when nations need to work together, Meridia makes it possible.

**Why they're at the Conclave**: The corrupt capitalist breaks the sacred principle of fair exchange—hoarding value instead of trading it. This threatens the foundation of how Meridia understands the world.
