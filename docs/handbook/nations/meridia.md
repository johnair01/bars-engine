## The Nation's Story

Meridia stands at high noon, where everything is illuminated and nothing hides. This is the nation of clear sight, fair exchange, and the understanding that true power comes from balance.

Citizens of Meridia are traders in the deepest sense—not just of goods, but of value itself. They understand that every interaction is an exchange, and the most successful deals are the ones where everyone walks away richer. They see through pretense not with cynicism but with the kind clarity of midday sun.

In Meridia, shadows are short because there's nothing to hide. Attachments are released through the simple practice of fair exchange: old for new, what no longer serves for what does. Everything in balance, everything in its proper place under the golden light.

### In the Robot Oscars Heist

Meridia's role is **the negotiation**. Getting past guards? That's a deal to be made. Need equipment? That's value to be exchanged. Every obstacle is an opportunity for mutual benefit—if you're clear-sighted enough to see it.

Their constructs are fortress-like yet graceful—defensive systems that protect while enabling movement, enduring foundations that support rather than dominate. They stand like mountains at noon: solid, clear, unmistakable.

### What Playing Meridia Feels Like

You're the crew's center of gravity. The one who sees situations clearly and finds win-win solutions. You create stability that empowers others to take risks.

**Your construct style**: Defensive matrices, support systems, enduring presence.

**Your challenge**: Sometimes perfect balance means not choosing sides when you should.

**Your triumph**: When your clarity and fairness turn enemies into allies.

## The Four Moves of Meridia

### 👁 Wake Up: Noon Clarity
*Stand in the full light and see all things as they are.*

Awareness in Meridia is radical honesty. No shadows, no illusions, no comforting lies. See things exactly as they are—that's where wisdom begins.

### 🧹 Clean Up: Fair Exchange
*Release attachments by trading old for new.*

Shadow work is commerce. What are you holding that no longer serves? Trade it. Not by burning or analyzing, but by consciously exchanging it for something of greater value. Release through fair transaction with yourself.

### 🌱 Grow Up: Market Mastery
*Learn the art of value creation and exchange.*

Growth is understanding value. Not just money, but all forms of value—time, attention, energy, connection. As you master the art of recognizing and creating value, you grow in power and wisdom.

### 🎯 Show Up: Golden Deal
*Take action through negotiation and mutual benefit.*

Every action is a negotiation. Every interaction is an exchange. Meridians act by finding the deal where everyone benefits—that's how you move mountains. Through clarity, fairness, and value creation.
