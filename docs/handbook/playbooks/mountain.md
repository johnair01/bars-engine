## The Playbook's Story

Mountain doesn't chase—Mountain *waits*. This is the playbook of those who understand that sometimes the most powerful move is perfect stillness. Not hesitation, not fear—conscious, deliberate stopping.

When you embody Mountain, you're the immovable object. When everyone else is running, you stop and assess. When chaos swirls, you rest in stillness. You know that motion without purpose is just noise, and stillness with awareness is profound power.

### In the Robot Oscars Heist

You're the one who says "Wait." Who stops the crew before they make a fatal mistake. Who stands immovable when pressure mounts. Your stillness isn't passive—it's the most active choice possible.

**Your construct affinity**: Defensive positions, holding ground, meditation protocols.

**Your strength**: You STOP. You rest. You hold ground absolutely.

**Your challenge**: Stillness can become stagnation. Sometimes you need to move.

**Your triumph**: When your perfect stillness reveals the right moment to act.
