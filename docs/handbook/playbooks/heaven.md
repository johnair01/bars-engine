## The Playbook's Story

Heaven doesn't wait for permission. Heaven *begins*. This is the playbook of leaders who see what needs to happen and make it so through sheer persistent will.

When you embody Heaven, you're the one who steps forward when everyone else hesitates. You don't need consensus—you need clarity of vision and the strength to persist despite resistance. You're the creative force that gets things moving.

### In the Robot Oscars Heist

You're the one who says "We're doing this" and everyone else follows because your certainty is magnetic. When the plan stalls, you restart it. When energy flags, you reignite it.

**Your construct affinity**: Command systems, leadership cores, initiating strikes.

**Your strength**: You START things. You PERSIST. You lead.

**Your challenge**: Not everything needs your direction. Sometimes others need space to lead.

**Your triumph**: When your unstoppable initiative turns "impossible" into "already happening."
