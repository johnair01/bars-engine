## The Archetype's Story

You're the person who shifts things without anyone noticing until it's done. Not through force, but through gentle, persistent influence. You're the conversation that changes a mind, the small action repeated until it's transformed everything.

Wind energy is about patient penetration. You don't break doors—you find the cracks and widen them so gently that eventually they're open. Soft, subtle, but utterly unstoppable over time.

**Example Archetypes**:
- The Gentle Influencer
- The Patient Transformer
- The Unseen Changer

**Your strength**: You PENETRATE everywhere. You change things subtly but totally.

**Your challenge**: Subtlety can feel invisible. Sometimes you want to be SEEN, not just effective.
