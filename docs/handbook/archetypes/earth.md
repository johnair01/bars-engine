## The Archetype's Story

You're the one people come to when they need grounding. Not because you're weak or passive, but because your strength is in receiving, supporting, and holding space. You know that the most powerful thing you can do is be the foundation others build on.

Earth energy is about devoted presence. You yield not from fear but from wisdom—understanding that softness can absorb impacts that would shatter hardness. Your power is in being exactly what others need, when they need it.
